# SmartStudy

Website Overview:

The SmartStudy website was created to present my app concept in a clear and accessible way.
The website explains the purpose of the app, its target audience, and its main features,
including study tips, motivation, and learning support.

The website also highlights how SmartStudy lifts others up by encouraging students,
reducing academic stress, and promoting confidence in learning. It was designed using
Canva as a no-code solution, allowing me to focus on user experience, visual clarity,
and impact rather than complex programming.

This website acts as the main presentation of my product and allows viewers to understand
how the app works and how it empowers individuals and communities through education.

This project was created as part of the IB MYP Personal Project and connects to the
Ds global context: Lifting others up empowers individuals and communities.

Tools used:
- Canva (website & design)
- Google Forms (quizzes & feedback)
- Zoho App Creator (app planning)
